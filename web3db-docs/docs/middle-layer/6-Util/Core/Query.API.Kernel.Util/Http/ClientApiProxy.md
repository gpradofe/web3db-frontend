# ClientApiProxy.cs Documentation

The `ClientApiProxy.cs` file defines a class `ClientApiProxy` that serves as a base for making HTTP requests and handling responses within the Query API Kernel. This class provides a robust way to interact with external services or APIs by encapsulating the logic for sending HTTP requests (GET, POST, DELETE, PATCH) and processing the responses.

## Components

### Attributes

- **\_client**: An instance of `HttpClient` used for executing HTTP requests.
- **\_logger**: An instance of `ILogger<ClientApiProxy>` used for logging information, warnings, and errors.

### Constructor

The constructor initializes the `ClientApiProxy` with the necessary `HttpClient` and `ILogger<ClientApiProxy>` instances.

```csharp
public ClientApiProxy(ILogger<ClientApiProxy> logger, HttpClient client)
{
    _logger = logger;
    _client = client;
}
```

### Methods

#### Protected Methods

- **Response\<T\>**: Processes the HTTP response, ensuring success status codes, deserializing the JSON content to the specified type `T`, and logging any errors encountered.

#### Public Methods

- **GetAsync\<TOutput\>**: Asynchronously sends a GET request to the specified action and returns the response deserialized to the type `TOutput`.
- **PostAsJsonAsync\<TOutput, TInput\>**: Asynchronously sends a POST request with a JSON payload of type `TInput` to the specified action and returns the response deserialized to the type `TOutput`.
- **DeleteAsync\<TOutput\>**: Asynchronously sends a DELETE request to the specified action and returns the response deserialized to the type `TOutput`.
- **PatchAsJsonAsync\<TOutput, TInput\>**: Asynchronously sends a PATCH request with a JSON payload of type `TInput` to the specified action and returns the response deserialized to the type `TOutput`.

## Usage Example

The `ClientApiProxy` class can be used as a base class for any service that needs to interact with an external API. Here's a simplified usage example for making a GET request:

```csharp
public class MyService : ClientApiProxy
{
    public MyService(ILogger<MyService> logger, HttpClient client)
        : base(logger, client)
    {
    }

    public async Task<MyResponseType> GetMyDataAsync(string action)
    {
        return await GetAsync<MyResponseType>(action);
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates how to extend `ClientApiProxy` to create a specific service (`MyService`) that makes GET requests to retrieve data of type `MyResponseType`.

## Conclusion

The `ClientApiProxy.cs` file provides a comprehensive solution for making HTTP requests and handling responses in a consistent and error-handled manner. It simplifies the interaction with external APIs by abstracting the complexities of request execution and response processing.
