# QueryAPIKernel

Welcome to the QueryAPIKernel solution documentation. This guide provides an overview of the solution structure, explains the design choices, and offers insights into each component's purpose. Our solution is organized to promote separation of concerns, modularity, and ease of navigation, ensuring efficient development and maintenance.

## Overview

The QueryAPIKernel solution is structured into several key folders that encapsulate specific layers of the application. Here's a brief overview of each top-level folder:

- `1-1-Presentation`: Contains everything related to the presentation layer, including API endpoints, configuration for startup, and base classes for controllers.

  <DocCard
    item={{
      type: "link",
      label: "Presentation Layer",
      href: "/docs/presentation",
      description: "Explore the Presentation layer documentation.",
    }}
  />

- `2-Application`: Defines the application's core functionality and orchestrates the flow between the domain and presentation layers.

  <DocCard
    item={{
      type: "link",
      label: "Application Core",
      href: "/docs/application",
      description: "Dive into the Application core functionalities.",
    }}
  />

- `3-Services`: Typically includes external services and integrations.
- `4-Domain`: Captures the business logic and domain entities that represent the core concepts of the solution.

  <DocCard
    item={{
      type: "link",
      label: "Domain Logic",
      href: "/docs/domain",
      description: "Learn about the Domain logic and entities.",
    }}
  />

- `5-Infrastructure`: Usually houses data access layers, external service configurations, and other cross-cutting concerns.
- `6-Util`: Provides utility classes and helpers that can be used throughout the application to perform common tasks.

## Folder Structure Details

### 1-1-Presentation

The presentation layer is where the application interacts with the outside world. It is split into two main components:

- `Core`: This subfolder contains foundational classes for setting up the API:
  - `APIBASE`: Houses the base classes, filters, and Swagger configuration necessary for API operations.
  - `Query.API.Kernel`: Contains the API controllers, settings, and startup configuration specific to the QueryAPIKernel service.

### 2-Application

This layer holds the application logic and is responsible for the execution of business rules:

- `Core`: Divided into two parts:
  - `Query.API.Kernel.Application`: Encapsulates the application's core actions and interfaces, detailing how data queries are sent and processed.
  - `Query.API.Kernel.Application.Worker`: Intended for background processes and workers that can run independently of user-initiated actions.

### 4-Domain

The domain layer represents the business logic and domain-specific knowledge:

- `Core`: Consists of entities and domain services that define the business rules and behaviors.
  - `Query.API.Kernel.Domain.Core`: Contains abstract entity interfaces and database settings entities.
  - `Query.API.Kernel.Domain`: Holds the implementation of domain contracts, data transfer objects (DTOs), and query operations.

### 6-Util

Utilities provide reusable code modules that support the functionality of the application:

- `Core`: Contains utility classes that perform parsing, handle exceptions, and extend the functionality of HTTP operations.
  - `Query.API.Kernel.Util`: Includes parsing utilities, custom exceptions, and HTTP client helpers.
  - `Map`: Provides extension methods for mapping operations.

## Design Philosophy

The folder structure is designed with the following principles in mind:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a distinct responsibility, reducing dependencies and making the codebase more manageable.
- **Scalability**: The modular nature allows for easy scaling of the application. New components can be added with minimal impact on existing code.
- **Maintainability**: Clear boundaries and organization facilitate easier maintenance and faster onboarding of new developers.

## Deployment

The QueryAPIKernel solution can be easily deployed using Docker. The provided `Dockerfile` defines the necessary steps to build and run the application in a containerized environment.

  }}
/>

## Conclusion

The QueryAPIKernel solution's folder structure is thoughtfully designed to provide a clear, maintainable, and scalable foundation for building robust API services. By adhering to industry best practices and architectural principles, this structure supports a clean separation of concerns and encourages a modular approach to application development.
