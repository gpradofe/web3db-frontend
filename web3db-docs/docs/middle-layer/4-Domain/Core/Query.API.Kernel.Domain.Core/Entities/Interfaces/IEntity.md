# Documentation for `IEntity.cs`

## Overview

`IEntity.cs` is part of the Domain Layer within the system's architecture. This file defines a generic interface `IEntity<T>` that serves as a contract for all entity types within the system. Entities, in the context of Domain-Driven Design (DDD), are objects that are not defined by their attributes, but rather by a thread of continuity and identity.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the `IEntity<T>` interface is to enforce a standard structure for all entities in the domain model. It acts as a marker interface to denote classes that are considered entities. This can be useful for reflection, entity tracking, and ensuring that certain operations or services are only applicable to entity types.

## Interface Definition

```csharp
public interface IEntity<in T> where T : class
{
}
```

### Type Parameters

- `T`: The type of the entity. It is constrained to be a class, indicating that only reference types can be entities.

### Methods and Properties

The interface, as defined, does not contain any methods or properties. It serves as a marker interface to indicate that a certain class is an entity.

## Usage

Implementing the `IEntity<T>` interface is straightforward. Here is an example of how a class might implement this interface to indicate it is an entity:

```csharp
public class User : IEntity<User>
{
    public Guid Id { get; set; }
    // Other properties and methods specific to the User entity
}
```

In this example, `User` is defined as an entity with a unique identifier (`Id`) and potentially other properties and behaviors relevant to users in the domain.

## Conclusion

`IEntity.cs` plays a foundational role in the domain model by establishing a contract for entity classes. While it doesn't prescribe specific properties or behaviors, its presence helps to enforce the design principle that certain classes represent entities with identity and lifecycle.
