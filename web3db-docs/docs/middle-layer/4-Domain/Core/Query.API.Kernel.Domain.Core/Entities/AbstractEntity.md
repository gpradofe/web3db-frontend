# AbstractEntity.cs Documentation

The `AbstractEntity.cs` file defines a foundational class from which entities in the application can inherit. This abstract class encompasses a basic structure for entities, ensuring they have an identifier and potentially other shared properties or methods in the future. Here's an overview of its structure and purpose.

## Overview

- **Namespace**: `Query.API.Kernel.Domain.Core.Entities`
- **Purpose**: To provide a base class for entity models within the application, ensuring they all have an identifier (`Id`).

## Class Signature

```csharp
public abstract class AbstractEntity<TEntity, TId> : IEntity<TEntity> where TEntity : class
```

### Type Parameters

- **`TEntity`**: The type of the entity inheriting from `AbstractEntity`. It must be a class.
- **`TId`**: The type of the identifier (`Id`) for the entity. It can be an `int`, `Guid`, or any other type suited as an identifier.

### Implements

- **`IEntity<TEntity>`**: This ensures that all entities inheriting from `AbstractEntity` must also implement the `IEntity<TEntity>` interface.

## Properties

- **`Id`**: The unique identifier for the entity. Its type is `TId`, which is a generic parameter allowing for flexibility in the type of the identifier used by different entities.

## Constructor

- **`protected AbstractEntity()`**: A protected constructor that ensures only derived classes can be instantiated. This is a key aspect of an abstract class, which is not meant to be instantiated on its own but rather to provide a common base for other classes.

## Usage Example

Imagine we have an entity `Product` in our application, and we want to ensure it has an identifier. We could define `Product` like this:

```csharp
public class Product : AbstractEntity<Product, int>
{
    // Additional properties specific to the Product entity
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
}
```

In this example, `Product` inherits from `AbstractEntity` with `TEntity` as `Product` and `TId` as `int`, making the `Id` property of type `int`. This setup enforces that every `Product` has an `Id`, and it inherits any other functionality `AbstractEntity` provides or will provide in the future.

## Conclusion

`AbstractEntity.cs` establishes a foundational structure for entities in the application, ensuring consistency and reusability by providing an `Id` property to all derived entities. It exemplifies the use of abstract classes and generic programming in designing flexible and maintainable code.
