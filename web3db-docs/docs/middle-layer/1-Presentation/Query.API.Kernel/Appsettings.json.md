# Documentation for `appsettings.json`

The `appsettings.json` file is a standard configuration file used in ASP.NET Core projects. It is used for storing and managing application settings and configurations in a structured JSON format. This file allows developers to easily configure and retrieve settings without hard-coding them into the application's source code. The settings stored in `appsettings.json` can be accessed throughout the application via the `IConfiguration` interface.

## Structure

The `appsettings.json` file in question contains configuration settings specifically for the "Query" functionality of an application. Here is the content of the file:

```json
{
  "Query": {
    "Url": "https://44.210.149.78:5000/"
  }
}
```

### Fields

- **Query**: This is the parent object that encapsulates the settings related to the Query functionality.
  - **Url**: This property specifies the URL endpoint of the Query service. In this case, the URL is `https://44.210.149.78:5000/`. This is likely the base URL where the Query API or service is hosted.

## Usage Example

Accessing configuration settings within an ASP.NET Core application involves injecting the `IConfiguration` interface into classes where these settings are needed. Below is an example of how to access the `Url` setting from the `appsettings.json` file:

```csharp
public class QueryService
{
    private readonly string _queryServiceUrl;

    public QueryService(IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        // Retrieve the Query URL from appsettings.json
        _queryServiceUrl = configuration.GetValue<string>("Query:Url");
    }
}
```

In this example, the `QueryService` class retrieves the `Url` setting under the `Query` section of the `appsettings.json` file using the `GetValue<T>` method of the `IConfiguration` interface. This URL can then be used to configure HTTP clients or other components that need to communicate with the Query service.

## Summary

The `appsettings.json` file is a critical component in ASP.NET Core applications for managing application-level settings and configurations. By storing the URL of the Query service in `appsettings.json`, developers can easily adjust the service endpoint without modifying the codebase, facilitating smoother deployments and configuration changes.
