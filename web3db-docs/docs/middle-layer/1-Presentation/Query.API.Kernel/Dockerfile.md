### Dockerfile Documentation

The `Dockerfile` provided is a blueprint for building a Docker image tailored for running a .NET 6 ASP.NET Core application. This Dockerfile is structured to facilitate both development and production needs, emphasizing efficient development cycles and straightforward deployment. Below is an elaborated breakdown of the Dockerfile's contents and functionalities.

---

#### **Stages of the Dockerfile:**

1. **Base Image (for running the application):**

   ```docker
   FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:6.0 AS base
   WORKDIR /app
   EXPOSE 80
   EXPOSE 443
   ```

   - **Purpose:** Sets up the runtime environment for the application.
   - **Key Points:**
     - Uses `dotnet/aspnet:6.0` as the base image, optimized for running .NET 6 applications.
     - Sets `/app` as the working directory.
     - Exposes ports `80` and `443` for HTTP and HTTPS traffic, respectively.

2. **Build Image (for compiling the application):**

   ```docker
   FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:6.0 AS build
   WORKDIR /src
   COPY ["1.1-Presentation/Query.API.Kernel/Query.API.Kernel.csproj", "1.1-Presentation/Query.API.Kernel/"]
   RUN dotnet restore "1.1-Presentation/Query.API.Kernel/Query.API.Kernel.csproj"
   COPY . .
   WORKDIR "/src/1.1-Presentation/Query.API.Kernel"
   RUN dotnet build "Query.API.Kernel.csproj" -c Release -o /app/build
   ```

   - **Purpose:** Compiles the application from source code.
   - **Key Points:**
     - Uses `dotnet/sdk:6.0` image, containing tools necessary for building .NET applications.
     - Copies the project file (`Query.API.Kernel.csproj`) and restores its dependencies.
     - Copies the rest of the source code.
     - Compiles the application in Release configuration, outputting to `/app/build`.

3. **Publish Image (for preparing the application release):**

   ```docker
   FROM build AS publish
   RUN dotnet publish "Query.API.Kernel.csproj" -c Release -o /app/publish /p:UseAppHost=false
   ```

   - **Purpose:** Creates a publishable version of the application, ready for deployment.
   - **Key Points:**
     - Continues from the `build` stage.
     - Publishes the application, optimizing for size by setting `UseAppHost=false`.

4. **Final Image (for deploying the application):**
   ```docker
   FROM base AS final
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY --from=publish /app/publish .
   ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "Query.API.Kernel.dll"]
   ```
   - **Purpose:** Prepares the final image containing only the necessary components to run the application.
   - **Key Points:**
     - Starts from the `base` image.
     - Copies the published application from the `publish` stage.
     - Sets the entry point to run the application.

#### **Key Takeaways:**

- This Dockerfile employs a multi-stage build process to minimize the final image size, improving deployment efficiency.
- It carefully separates the build environment from the runtime environment, adopting best practices for .NET application deployment in containers.
- Customization can be performed by adjusting the base images, exposed ports, or the ENTRYPOINT directive to meet specific application requirements.

This Dockerfile is designed to be used with Visual Studio for enhanced debugging experiences but can also be utilized in various CI/CD workflows for automated builds and deployments.
