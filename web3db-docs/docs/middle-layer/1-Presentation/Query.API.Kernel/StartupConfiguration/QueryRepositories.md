## Documentation: QueryRepositories.cs

`QueryRepositories.cs` is a part of the application's startup configuration, specifically tailored for setting up the repository layer within the service collection of the ASP.NET Core application. This file is crucial for dependency injection (DI), which is a technique to achieve Inversion of Control (IoC) between classes and their dependencies.

## Overview

The `QueryRepositories` class is a static class defined within the `Query.API.Kernel.StartupConfiguration` namespace. The primary responsibility of this class is to extend the `IServiceCollection` interface with a method dedicated to registering repositories used within the application. Repositories are used to abstract the data layer, making it easier to manage data access logic and to work with different data sources.

## Method

### AddQueryRepositories

- **Purpose**: Registers repositories with the DI container.
- **Parameters**: `IServiceCollection services` - The collection of service descriptors where repositories should be registered.
- **Visibility**: `public static` - This method is publicly accessible and static, meaning it can be called without creating an instance of the `QueryRepositories` class.
- **Return Type**: `void` - This method does not return any value.

## Usage

In a typical ASP.NET Core application, `AddQueryRepositories` would be called within the `ConfigureServices` method of the `Startup.cs` file. However, in the current implementation, the method body is commented out, indicating that no specific repository registrations are being performed at the moment.

### Example

Here's how you might typically use it within `Startup.cs`:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddQueryRepositories();
    // Other service configurations...
}
```

## Notes

- The commented-out code suggests that the template is prepared to include repository registrations, but these are not currently implemented.
- Normally, the commented line would be replaced with actual repository registrations, like `services.AddTransient<IProductRepository, ProductRepository>();`, assuming `IProductRepository` and `ProductRepository` were part of the application.
- This file represents a foundational piece for organizing data access layer registrations in a way that promotes maintainability and scalability.

## Future Enhancements

To utilize `QueryRepositories.cs` effectively, consider implementing specific repository interfaces and their concrete implementations. Once defined, use `AddQueryRepositories` to register these repositories with the DI container, thus enabling their use across the application with DI principles.
