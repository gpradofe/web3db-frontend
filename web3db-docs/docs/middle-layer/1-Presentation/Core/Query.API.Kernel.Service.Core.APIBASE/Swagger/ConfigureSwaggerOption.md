# ConfigureSwaggerOptions.cs Documentation

`ConfigureSwaggerOptions.cs` is a crucial part of setting up Swagger for API versioning and documentation in the ASP.NET Core project. It implements the `IConfigureOptions<SwaggerGenOptions>` interface, allowing it to configure Swagger generator options based on the API versioning provided by the `IApiVersionDescriptionProvider` service.

## Overview

Swagger is an open-source software framework backed by a large ecosystem of tools that helps developers design, build, document, and consume RESTful web services. It also provides tools for generating client SDKs for various languages and server stubs in different technologies. Adding Swagger to an ASP.NET Core project enhances the development, testing, and documentation phases of API lifecycle management.

## Key Components

- **IApiVersionDescriptionProvider**: Injected to provide details about the API versions available. It is used to generate Swagger documentation for each version dynamically.

- **SwaggerGenOptions**: Configured in the `Configure` method to set up Swagger documentation based on the API version descriptions provided by the `IApiVersionDescriptionProvider`.

## Code Explained

### Attributes and Constructor

```csharp
readonly IApiVersionDescriptionProvider provider;

public ConfigureSwaggerOptions(IApiVersionDescriptionProvider provider) => this.provider = provider;
```

The `provider` attribute is initialized in the constructor, enabling access to API version descriptions throughout the class.

### Configure Method

```csharp
public void Configure(SwaggerGenOptions options)
{
    foreach (var description in provider.ApiVersionDescriptions)
    {
        options.SwaggerDoc($"{description.GroupName}", CreateInfoForApiVersion(description));
    }
}
```

This method iterates through all API version descriptions and configures Swagger documents for each API version detected. The `CreateInfoForApiVersion` is a helper method used to create the `OpenApiInfo` object for each version, which includes metadata like the title, version, and description.

### CreateInfoForApiVersion Method

```csharp
static OpenApiInfo CreateInfoForApiVersion(ApiVersionDescription description)
{
    var info = new OpenApiInfo()
    {
        Title = "ARSTInventoryKernel",
        Version = description.ApiVersion.ToString(),
        Description = "",
    };
    
    if (description.IsDeprecated)
    {
        info.Description += " This API version has been deprecated.";
    }
    
    return info;
}
```

A static method that generates an `OpenApiInfo` object containing information about a specific API version. This includes the API's title, version number, and a description that marks the API as deprecated if applicable.

## Usage

This class is typically used in the `Startup.cs` or equivalent initialization file, where it is registered as part of the Swagger generation services configuration. It ensures that Swagger documentation accurately reflects the versions of the API available, enhancing the developer experience and API usability.

## Conclusion

`ConfigureSwaggerOptions.cs` plays a vital role in integrating Swagger with ASP.NET Core projects that use API versioning. By dynamically generating Swagger documentation for each version, it aids in maintaining clear and accurate API documentation, thus supporting better development and consumption of the APIs.
