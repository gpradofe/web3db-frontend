# Deployment

The QueryAPIKernel solution can be easily deployed using Docker, which provides a consistent and reproducible environment for running the application. Docker allows you to package the application along with its dependencies into a container, making it easy to deploy and scale.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- Docker: Make sure you have Docker installed on your machine. If you don't have Docker installed, you can download and install it from the official website: [https://www.docker.com/get-started](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

## Building the Docker Image

To build the Docker image for the QueryAPIKernel solution, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the root directory of the QueryAPIKernel solution in your terminal.

2. Run the following command to build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t queryapikernel .
```

This command will build the Docker image using the provided `Dockerfile` and tag it as `queryapikernel`. The `.` at the end specifies the build context, which is the current directory.

The `Dockerfile` contains the instructions for building the image, such as specifying the base image, copying the application files, installing dependencies, and configuring the runtime environment.

## Running the Docker Container

Once the Docker image is built, you can run a container based on that image. To run the QueryAPIKernel container, use the following command:

```bash
docker run -d -p 80:80 -p 443:443 --name queryapikernel-container queryapikernel
```

Let's break down the command:

- `-d`: Runs the container in detached mode, which means it runs in the background.
- `-p 80:80 -p 443:443`: Maps the container's ports 80 and 443 to the host's ports 80 and 443, respectively. This allows accessing the application using the host's IP or domain.
- `--name queryapikernel-container`: Assigns a name to the container for easier identification and management.
- `queryapikernel`: Specifies the image to use for creating the container.

## Accessing the Application

After the container is up and running, you can access the QueryAPIKernel application by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost` (for HTTP) or `https://localhost` (for HTTPS).

If you are deploying the application on a remote server, replace `localhost` with the server's IP address or domain name.

## Additional Docker Commands

Here are some additional Docker commands that can be useful for managing the QueryAPIKernel container:

- To stop the running container:

  ```bash
  docker stop queryapikernel-container
  ```

- To start a stopped container:

  ```bash
  docker start queryapikernel-container
  ```

- To remove the container:

  ```bash
  docker rm queryapikernel-container
  ```

- To view the logs of the container:

  ```bash
  docker logs queryapikernel-container
  ```

## Deploying to Production

When deploying the QueryAPIKernel solution to a production environment, consider the following additional steps:

1. **Set Environment Variables**: Use environment variables to configure sensitive information such as database connection strings, API keys, and other settings. You can pass environment variables to the container using the `-e` flag during the `docker run` command.

2. **Use a Reverse Proxy**: In a production environment, it's recommended to use a reverse proxy like Nginx or Apache in front of the QueryAPIKernel container. The reverse proxy can handle tasks like SSL termination, load balancing, and request routing. If you don't have Nginx or Apache installed, you can download them from their official websites:

   - Nginx: [https://nginx.org/en/download.html](https://nginx.org/en/download.html)
   - Apache: [https://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi](https://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi)

3. **Configure Logging and Monitoring**: Set up proper logging and monitoring solutions to track the application's performance, errors, and usage metrics. You can use tools like ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Prometheus and Grafana for logging and monitoring. If you need to install these tools, refer to their official documentation:

   - ELK stack: [https://www.elastic.co/guide/index.html](https://www.elastic.co/guide/index.html)
   - Prometheus: [https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/)
   - Grafana: [https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/installation/](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/installation/)

4. **Implement Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)**: Automate the build, testing, and deployment process using CI/CD pipelines. This ensures consistent and reliable deployments and reduces the risk of manual errors. Popular CI/CD tools include Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, and Azure DevOps. If you need to set up a CI/CD pipeline, refer to the documentation of your chosen CI/CD tool.

5. **Backup and Disaster Recovery**: Regularly backup your application data and configurations. Have a disaster recovery plan in place to minimize downtime and data loss in case of any unforeseen events. You can use tools like Docker volumes or cloud-based storage solutions for data backup.

## Conclusion

Deploying the QueryAPIKernel solution using Docker simplifies the deployment process and provides a consistent runtime environment. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can easily build the Docker image, run the container, and access the application.

Remember to consider additional factors such as environment variables, reverse proxy, logging, monitoring, CI/CD, and backup when deploying to a production environment.

If you have any further questions or need assistance with the deployment process, please refer to the Docker documentation or reach out to our support team.
