## **QueryApplication.cs Documentation**

### Overview

`QueryApplication.cs` is part of the Application layer in the Query API Kernel project. This class implements the `IQueryApplication` interface, serving as the intermediary between the presentation layer (API controllers) and the domain logic for executing queries. Its primary responsibility is to orchestrate the process of sending a query and retrieving its results.

### Responsibilities

- **Query Execution:** Handles the logic to execute a query through the `ISendQueryAction` interface.
- **Logging:** Utilizes `ILogger` for logging purposes, aiding in debugging and monitoring.

### Implementation Details

#### Attributes

- `ILogger<QueryApplication> _logger`: Used for logging.
- `ISendQueryAction _sendQueryAction`: Responsible for actually sending the query and fetching results.

#### Constructor

```csharp
public QueryApplication(ILogger<QueryApplication> logger, ISendQueryAction sendQueryAction)
```

- Initializes the `QueryApplication` with necessary dependencies for logging and query execution.

#### Methods

- `SendQueryAndGetResultsAsync(SendQueryDTO queryDto)`

  - **Parameters:** Accepts a `SendQueryDTO` object containing the details of the query to be executed.
  - **Returns:** A `Task<ReturnQueryResults>` which upon completion provides the results of the executed query encapsulated in a `ReturnQueryResults` object.
  - **Description:** Asynchronously sends a query using the `_sendQueryAction` and returns the results. Utilizes try-catch for exception handling.

### Usage Example

Below is a simplified usage example in a hypothetical API controller:

```csharp
public class QueryController : ApiControllerBase<QueryController>
{
    private readonly IQueryApplication _queryApplication;

    public QueryController(IQueryApplication queryApplication)
    {
        _queryApplication = queryApplication;
    }

    [HttpPost("SendQuery")]
    public async Task<IActionResult> PostNewQuery([FromBody] SendQueryDTO sendQueryDTO)
    {
        try
        {
            var response = await _queryApplication.SendQueryAndGetResultsAsync(sendQueryDTO);
            return Ok(response);
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            // Handle exception
            throw;
        }
    }
}
```

### Conclusion

`QueryApplication.cs` plays a crucial role in the Query API Kernel architecture by bridging the gap between the API's presentation layer and its underlying domain logic related to query execution. Its design adheres to separation of concerns by offloading the actual query execution to another component (`ISendQueryAction`), keeping the application layer lean and focused on orchestration.
