# Documentation: SendQueryAction.cs

## Overview

`SendQueryAction.cs` is part of the Query.API.Kernel application, specifically within the Application layer's Query actions. It implements the `ISendQueryAction` interface to define a concrete action for sending queries and receiving results. This class plays a pivotal role in facilitating communication between the application and external services or databases by sending queries and processing the responses.

## Implementation

This class extends `ClientApiProxy`, allowing it to leverage HTTP client functionalities such as sending HTTP requests and handling responses. It is designed to interact with an external service or database, sending queries packaged in a `SendQueryDTO` and awaiting results encapsulated in a `ReturnQueryResults` object.

### Constructor

- **Parameters:**
  - `ILogger<SendQueryAction> logger`: A logger instance for logging information or errors.
  - `HttpClient client`: The HTTP client used to send requests.

### Public Methods

#### SendQueryAsync

- **Purpose:** Sends a query to an external service and returns the results.
- **Signature:** `Task<ReturnQueryResults> SendQueryAsync(SendQueryDTO query)`
- **Parameters:**
  - `SendQueryDTO query`: The query data transfer object containing the query details.
- **Returns:** An asynchronous task that, when executed, returns a `ReturnQueryResults` object containing the query results.
- **Exceptions:** Propagates any exceptions encountered during the operation.

## Usage Example

```csharp
var logger = serviceProvider.GetService<ILogger<SendQueryAction>>();
var httpClient = serviceProvider.GetService<HttpClient>();

// Assuming DI container or service provider setup
var sendQueryAction = new SendQueryAction(logger, httpClient);

var queryDto = new SendQueryDTO
{
    // Initialization of query DTO as per requirements
};

try
{
    var result = await sendQueryAction.SendQueryAsync(queryDto);
    Console.WriteLine($"Query Results: {result}");
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Error sending query: {ex.Message}");
}
```

In this example, an instance of `SendQueryAction` is created with the necessary `ILogger` and `HttpClient` instances. A `SendQueryDTO` object is initialized with the query details. The `SendQueryAsync` method is then called with the `queryDto` as the parameter, and the results are processed upon successful completion.

## Conclusion

`SendQueryAction.cs` serves as a crucial component in the Query.API.Kernel application, enabling the sending of queries to external services or databases and the processing of returned results. Through its implementation, it abstracts the complexities involved in HTTP communication, providing a simplified interface for executing queries and handling responses.
