# IQueryApplication.cs Documentation

## Overview

`IQueryApplication.cs` defines the core interface `IQueryApplication` that outlines essential functionalities for processing queries within the application. This interface acts as a contract that must be implemented by any class that aims to handle sending queries and retrieving their results, encapsulating the logic and operations related to query execution within the application's domain.

## Interface: `IQueryApplication`

### Purpose

The purpose of the `IQueryApplication` interface is to provide an abstraction layer for handling query operations, ensuring that the application can send queries and process the results in a consistent and decoupled manner. This design promotes flexibility, as different implementations of this interface can be swapped or modified without affecting the broader application architecture.

### Methods

#### `SendQueryAndGetResultsAsync`

- **Signature**: `Task<ReturnQueryResults> SendQueryAndGetResultsAsync(SendQueryDTO queryDto)`
- **Parameters**:
  - `SendQueryDTO queryDto`: An instance of `SendQueryDTO` containing the details of the query to be sent.
- **Returns**: A task that, when awaited, returns an instance of `ReturnQueryResults` containing the results of the executed query.
- **Description**: This method is responsible for asynchronously sending a query to the designated data source or service, processing it, and returning the results. It encapsulates the logic for interacting with the underlying query execution mechanisms.

### Usage Example

While the `IQueryApplication.cs` file only defines the interface and not its implementation, the following is a hypothetical usage scenario:

```csharp
public class SomeController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly IQueryApplication _queryApplication;

    public SomeController(IQueryApplication queryApplication)
    {
        _queryApplication = queryApplication;
    }

    public async Task<IActionResult> GetQueryResultsAsync(SendQueryDTO queryDto)
    {
        try
        {
            var results = await _queryApplication.SendQueryAndGetResultsAsync(queryDto);
            return Ok(results);
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            // Handle exception
            return StatusCode(500, "An error occurred while processing the query.");
        }
    }
}
```

### Implementation Notes

To implement the `IQueryApplication` interface, a class needs to provide a concrete implementation of the `SendQueryAndGetResultsAsync` method, detailing how queries should be sent and how their results are to be processed and returned. Implementations may vary based on the application's specific requirements, the data source or service being queried, and the expected query results format.
