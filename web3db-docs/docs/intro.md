# Web3DB: Intro

Welcome to the documentation for our pioneering project, a **decentralized database engine** that revolutionizes data management by empowering users with unprecedented control over their information. This groundbreaking solution represents a paradigm shift in database design and operation, leveraging cutting-edge decentralized technologies and innovative access control methodologies to deliver unparalleled data security, scalability, and user sovereignty.

<Admonition type="info" title="Architecture Overview">
  Our decentralized database engine is built upon a robust, dual-component architecture that seamlessly integrates a high-performance middle layer written in C# with a sophisticated database technology stack.
</Admonition>

## Project Overview

Our decentralized database engine is designed to enable efficient, real-time communication between the user interface and the underlying data storage and retrieval mechanisms, ensuring optimal performance and reliability.

  <TabItem value="middle-layer" label="Middle Layer (C#)">
    The middle layer, developed using C# and the .NET framework, serves as the critical communication gateway between the frontend and the backend. This layer is meticulously designed to handle incoming queries and hashes with exceptional efficiency, leveraging advanced algorithms and data structures to process and dispatch requests to the backend with unparalleled precision.

    <Admonition type="note" title="Key Features">
      - Asynchronous request handling
      - Query optimization
      - Robust error handling
      - Scalable architecture
    </Admonition>

    By acting as a highly optimized pass-through connection, the middle layer ensures fluid and responsive data exchange, providing a solid foundation for the decentralized database engine.

  <TabItem value="database-tech" label="Database Technology and Setup">
    At the heart of our project lies a cutting-edge database technology stack that combines the power of distributed computing, big data processing, and decentralized storage. Our setup leverages industry-leading tools and platforms, including:

    - **Apache Spark**: A lightning-fast cluster computing framework that enables distributed processing of large-scale data sets.
    - **Apache Hive**: A data warehousing solution built on top of Hadoop, providing a SQL-like interface for querying and managing large datasets.
    - **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)**: A peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol designed to make the web faster, safer, and more open.

    Our database technology stack is orchestrated using Docker Compose, which simplifies the deployment and management of multi-container applications.

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  spark-master:
    image: spark-master:latest
    # ...
  hive-server:
    image: hive-server:latest
    # ...
  ipfs-node:
    image: ipfs-node:latest
    # ...
```

    One of the key innovations of our system is its ability to generate and modify data storage mechanisms on-the-fly, ensuring optimal resource utilization and enhanced security.

### Decentralization and User Data Ownership

Decentralization lies at the core of our database engine's philosophy, empowering users with true ownership and control over their data. By eliminating the need for a constantly running, centralized database instance, we mitigate the risks associated with single points of failure and data breaches.

<Admonition type="important">
  Our system leverages the immutability and versioning capabilities of IPFS to ensure the integrity and preservation of data history. Each query that modifies data results in the creation of a new hash, effectively capturing the changes made while maintaining a tamper-proof record of previous states.
</Admonition>

Through our decentralized architecture, users retain complete control over their data, with the ability to grant or revoke access permissions as they see fit. This paradigm shift in data ownership puts the power back in the hands of the users, fostering trust, privacy, and security in the digital landscape.

### Future Directions: Zero Trust Access Control

As we continue to push the boundaries of decentralized database technology, our focus will shift towards integrating a cutting-edge, **zero-trust access control policy** into our network. This research aims to establish a secure, reliable framework for data access that eliminates the reliance on centralized authorities and traditional trust models.

By leveraging advanced cryptographic techniques, such as multi-party computation and homomorphic encryption, we aim to create a decentralized access control system that enables fine-grained, dynamic permissions management without compromising data privacy or security.
